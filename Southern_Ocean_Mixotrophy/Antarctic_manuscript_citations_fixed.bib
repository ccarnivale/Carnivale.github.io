Cellular C and N content ranged from 48 to 3.0 X 104 pgC cell-' and 11 to 2,656 pgN cell-' for cells ranging in volume from 180 to 2.8 X 105 /um3. C and N density in dinoflagellates decreased significantly with increasing ce volume. C: N ratios ranged from 3.44 to 6.45. C: vol and N: vol in dinoflagellates are significantly related as expressed by the equations pgC cell-' = 0.760 X volume08'9 and pgN cell-' = 0.118 X volume0849. Previously published data were combined to compare C: vol relationships in different phylogenetic protist groups, including chlorophytes, chrysophytes, prasinophytes, and prymnesiophytes. Our analysis indicated differences between the C:vol relationships available for ciliates. A new C:vol relationship for diatoms was established (pgC cell-' = 0.288 X volume08"). Dinoflagellates are significantly more C dense than diatoms. Except for diatoms, we found few significant differences between C: vol relationships of different phylogenetic groups. Consequently, one C: vol relationship for taxonomically diverse protist plankton excluding diatoms was determined (pgC cell-' = 0.216 X volume0939). In the combined data set, carbon density was not constant but decreased significantly with increasing cell volume. Using constant C: vol conversion factors for plankton over large size ranges will cause systematic errors in biomass estimates.},

abstract = {The abundance, size structure and community composition of phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean were studied, using flow cytometry, microscopy and pigment profiles on two transects one latitudinal (N) and one longitudinal (W) during December 1999 and January 2000. In both transects, the concentration of autotrophic eukaryotes of 2-10 µm equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) commonly exceeded those < 2 µm ESD. No cells > 10 µm ESD were detected by flow cytometry (however microscopy showed cells> 10 µm in length). Throughout transect N, chlorophyll a concentrations were generally <0.5 µg 1 {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} 1 • South of the Antarctic Polar Front (APP), chlorophyll a concentrations increased southward. CHEMT AX allocation of pigment data (italicized) showed that Diatoms contributed most chlorophyll with Haptophytes subdominant. North of the APP, chlorophyll a concentrations tended to increase northward. Here, Haptophytes contributed most chlorophyll, followed by Diatoms, Chlorophytes and Cyanobacteria, except at the northernmost stations where Cyanobacteria dominated. In transect W, chlorophyll a concentrations were also <0.5 µg I-i in most cases, but variable. Higher concentra­ tions occasionally occurred in the west. In this transect, Diatoms contributed most (mean=6 l ± 15%) of the chlorophyll a, followed by Haptophytes. Nanodiatoms (particularly Fragilariopsis spp.) numerically dominated the diatom community. Fecal pellets composed of these nanodiatoms were observed in the Antarctic water, probably originating from heterotrophic dinoflagellates, implying a significant contribution of nanodiatoms to the microbial food web. However they contributed little to total chlorophyll a and diatom carbon biomass, particularly when chlorophyll and carbon concentrations were high.},

abstract = {Specific taxa and community structure of the phytoplankton and other protists in the North Water, a productive polynya ecosystem between Ellesmere Island (Canada) and Greenland, were determined from April to July 1998. Distinct temporal and spatial trends were observed within different geographic regions, influenced by water masses determined by temperature and salinity (TS) characteristics. In April, the northernmost communities were primarily flagellates and dinoflagellates, resembling those of the Arctic Basin, while large centric diatoms dominated in May and persisted through July. Throughout the rest of the polynya in April, centric diatoms and alveolates (ciliates and dinoflagellates) dominated. In the eastern part of the polynya in May and June, centric diatoms, especially Thalassiosira spp., reached very high levels, comprising 50-80% of biomass carbon there, while in July the eastern community was primarily Chaetoceros spp. and large alveolates. The community in the western region in April was more mixed, with Actinocyclus spp./Coscinodiscus spp. and alveolates as the dominant groups. In May and June, pennate-ribbon diatoms were mixed with Thalassiosira and Chaetoceros spp., while in July western biomass was primarily alveolates and Chaetoceros spp. Throughout the polynya and the 4-month sampling period, the community of phytoplankton and other protists was dominated by microplankton (20-200 $\mu$m). Records of this size class from the current study were comparable to historical records collected since 1876. The planktonic communities along the southern border of the North Water, which was ice-covered until mid-June and had TS characteristics of the West Greenland Current (WGC), differed from those in the rest of the polynya. They contained few planktonic diatoms and had a higher proportion of nanoplankton size (2-20 $\mu$m) flagellates and gymnodinoid dinoflagellates. The WGC microplankton were dominated by thecate dinoflagellates such as Ceratium arcticum. Overall, the diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom in the North Water was 2-3 months earlier than blooms in the southern region. In addition to blooming sooner, large cells persisted, were a dominant biomass component from May to July, and thus were major contributors to the overall productivity of the North Water. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Chlorophytes and haptophytes are key contributors to global phytoplankton biomass and productivity. Mixotrophic bacterivory has been detected for both groups, but a shortage of studies with cultured representatives hinders a consistent picture of the ecological relevance and regulation of this trophic strategy. Here, the growth, primary production, fraction of feeding cells (acidotropic probes) and bacterivory rates (surrogate prey) are tested for two species of the chlorophyte genus Nephroselmis and the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana under contrasting regimes of light (high vs. low) and nutrients (non-limited and macronutrient-, micronutrient- and vitamin-limited), at low bacterial concentrations (<107 bacteria mL−1). All three species were obligate phototrophs, unable to compensate for low light conditions through feeding. Under nutrient limitation, N. rotunda and I. galbana fed, but growth ceased or was significantly lower than in the control. Thus, mixotrophic bacterivory could be a survival rather than a growth strategy for certain species. In contrast, nutrient-limited N. pyriformis achieved growth rates equivalent to the control through feeding. This strikingly differs with the classical view of chlorophytes as primarily non-feeders and indicates mixotrophic bacterivory can be a significant trophic strategy for green algae, even at the low bacterial concentrations found in oligotrophic open oceans.},

abstract = {Estimates of primary production in the Southern Ocean are difficult to obtain but are essential if we are to understand its role in the global carbon cycle. Here we present a 9-year time series of daily primary production calculated from remotely sensed ocean color, sea surface temperature, and sea ice concentration using a primary production algorithm parameterized specifically for use in Southern Ocean waters. Results suggest that total annual production in waters south of 50°S averaged 1949 ± 70.1 Tg C a-1 (where a is years) between 1998 and 2006, approximately half that of previous estimates. The large but relatively unproductive pelagic province accounted for ∼90% of Southern Ocean production, while area normalized rates of production were greatest on the much smaller continental shelf (109 g C m-2 a-1). Surprisingly, production in the marginal ice zone was only slightly higher than in the pelagic province. The Ross Sea was the most productive sector of the Southern Ocean (mean = 503 Tg C a-1), followed closely by the Weddell Sea (mean = 477 Tg C a-1). Unlike the Arctic Ocean, there was no secular trend in either sea ice cover or annual primary production in the Southern Ocean during our 9-year study. Interannual variability in annual production was most closely tied to changes in sea ice cover, although changes in sea surface temperature also played a role. Only 31% of the variation in annual production was explained by the Southern Annular Mode. Annual primary production could increase in the future as stronger winds increase nutrient upwelling.

abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula region is undergoing rapid change: a warming in winter of almost 6 °C since 1950, the loss of six ice shelves, the retreat of 87% of the marine glaciers, and decreases in winter sea-ice duration. Concurrently, there is evidence of ecosystem change along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP). Since the life histories of most polar marine species are synchronized with the seasonal cycle of sea ice, we assess how the seasonal sea-ice cycle is changing in the wAP region. Four new metrics of seasonal sea-ice variability were extracted from spatial maps of satellite derived daily sea-ice concentration: (a) day of advance, (b) day of retreat, (c) the total number of sea-ice days (between day of advance and retreat), and (d) the percent time sea-ice was present (or sea-ice persistence). The spatio-temporal variability describes distinct on-to-offshore and alongshore differences in ice-ocean marine habitats, characterized overall by a longer sea-ice season in coastal regions (6.8-7.9 months) versus a shorter sea-ice season over the shelf (4.1-5.3 months), with on-to-offshore differences increasing south-to-north. Large perturbations in the seasonality of the marine habitat occur in association with ENSO and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) variability. The local atmospheric response to these climate modes is largely a strengthening of the meridional winds during spring-to-autumn, which in turn affect the timing of the sea-ice retreat and subsequent advance. These perturbations are embedded in overall trends towards a later sea-ice advance, earlier retreat and consequently shorter sea-ice season, the impacts of which are expected to affect ecosystem functionality in the wAP region. A suite of ocean-atmosphere-ice interactions are described that are consistent with the amplified warming in late autumn, early winter.},

abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that mean global warming was 0.6 ± 0.2 • C during the 20th century and cited anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases as the likely cause of temperature rise in the last 50 years. But this mean value conceals the substantial complexity of observed climate change, which is seasonally-and diurnally-biased, decadally-variable and geographically patchy. In particular, over the last 50 years three high-latitude areas have undergone recent rapid regional (RRR) warming, which was substantially more rapid than the global mean. However, each RRR warming occupies a different climatic regime and may have an entirely different underlying cause. We discuss the significance of RRR warming in one area, the Antarctic Peninsula. Here warming was much more rapid than in the rest of Antarctica where it was not significantly different to the global mean. We highlight climate proxies that appear to show that RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula is unprecedented over the last two millennia, and so unlikely to be a natural mode of variability. So while the station records do not indicate a ubiquitous polar amplification of global warming, the RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula might be a regional amplification of such warming. This, however, remains unproven since we cannot yet be sure what mechanism leads to such an amplification. We discuss several possible candidate mechanisms: changing oceanographic or changing atmospheric circulation, or a regional air-sea-ice feedback amplifying greenhouse warming. We can show that atmospheric warming and reduction in sea-ice duration coincide in a small area on the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, but here we cannot yet distinguish cause and effect. Thus for the present we cannot determine which process is the probable cause of RRR warming on the Antarctic Peninsula and until the mechanism initiating and sustaining the RRR warming is understood, and is convincingly reproduced in climate models, we lack a sound basis for predicting climate change in this region over the coming century.},

The objectives were to obtain information on the functioning of the microbial food web under the ice, during winter (from 21 December 2003 to 21 March 2004) and during spring (from 22 March 2004 to 29 May 2004), and to test whether bacterial losses would increase after the increase in bacterial production following the spring phytoplankton bloom. Chl a concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 0.36 $\mu$g L-1, increasing in March and reaching a peak in April. Bacterial biomass showed no consistent trend for the whole period, and protist biomass followed a pattern similar to that of Chl a. Bacterial production increased 1 week after Chl a concentrations started to increase, while bacterivory rates increased very slightly. Average bacterivory rates in winter (0.16 ± 0.07 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1) were not significantly different from those in spring (0.29 ± 0.24 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1). Average bacterial production, on the other hand, was similar to bacterivory rates in winter (0.19 ± 0.38 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1), but higher than bacterivory in spring (0.93 ± 0.28 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1).

abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms by which climate variability affects multiple trophic levels in food webs is essential for determining ecosystem responses to climate change. Here we use over two decades of data collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program (PAL-LTER) to determine how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect phytoplankton, zooplankton and an apex predator along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We show that positive anomalies in chlorophyll-$\alpha$ (chl-$\alpha$) at Palmer Station, occurring every 4-6 years, are constrained by physical processes in the preceding winter/spring and a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Favorable conditions for phytoplankton included increased winter ice extent and duration, reduced spring/summer winds, and increased water column stability via enhanced salinity-driven density gradients. Years of positive chl-a anomalies are associated with the initiation of a robust krill cohort the following summer, which is evident in Ad{\'{e}}lie penguin diets, thus demonstrating tight trophic coupling. Projected climate change in this region may have a significant, negative impact on phytoplankton biomass, krill recruitment and upper trophic level predators in this coastal Antarctic ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The use of dissolved nutrients and carbon for photosynthesis in the euphotic zone and the subsequent downward transport of particulate and dissolved organic material strongly affect carbon concentrations in surface water and thus the air-sea exchange of CO2. Efforts to quantify the downward carbon flux for the whole ocean or on basin-scales are hampered by the sparseness of direct productivity or flux measurements. Here, a global ocean circulation, biogeochemical model is used to determine rates of export production and vertical carbon fluxes in the Southern Ocean. The model exploits the existing large sets of hydrographic, oxygen, nutrient and carbon data that contain information on the underlying biogeochemical processes. The model is fitted to the data by systematically varying circulation, air-sea fluxes, production, and remineralization rates simultaneously. Use of the adjoint method yields model property simulations that are in very good agreement with measurements. In the model, the total integrated export flux of particulate organic matter necessary for the realistic reproduction of nutrient data is significantly larger than export estimates derived from primary productivity maps. Of the 10,000 TgC yr-1 (10 GtC yr-1) required globally, the Southern Ocean south of 30°S contributes about 3000 TgC yr-1 (33%), most of it occurring in a zonal belt along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and in the Peru, Chile and Namibia coastal upwelling regions. The export flux of POC for the area south of 50°S amounts to 1000±210 TgC yr-1, and the particle flux in 1000 m for the same area is 115±20 TgC yr-1. Unlike for the global ocean, the contribution of the downward flux of dissolved organic carbon is significant in the Southern Ocean in the top 500 m of the water column. Comparison with satellite-based productivity estimates (CZCS and SeaWiFS) shows a relatively good agreement over most of the ocean except for the Southern Ocean south of 50°S, where the model fluxes are systematically higher than the satellite-based values by factors between 2 and 5. This discrepancy is significant, and an attempt to reconcile the low satellite-derived productivity values with ocean-interior nutrient budgets failed. Too low productivity estimates from satellite chlorophyll observations in the polar and sub-polar Southern Ocean could arise because of the inability of the satellite sensors to detect frequently occurring sub-surface chlorophyll patches, and to a poor calibration of the conversion algorithms in the Southern Ocean because of the very limited amount of direct measurements. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mixotrophs are expected to have important effects on the trophic dynamics of ecosystems, but the exact nature of these effects is not known and likely varies with physiological type. In order to study the impact that mixotrophs may have on the microbial food web, we developed mathematical formulations that simulate each of the three aforementioned physiological types of mixotrophs. These were introduced into idealized, steady-state open ocean and coastal/estuar-ine environments. Our results indicate that mixotrophs compete for resources with both phytoplankton and zooplankton and that their relative abundance is a function of the feeding strategy (physiological type and whether or not they feed on zooplankton) and the maximum growth and/or grazing rates of the organisms. In our models coexistence of mixotrophs with phytoplankton and zooplankton generally occurs within reasonable parameter ranges, which suggests that mixotrophy represents a unique resource niche under summertime, quasi-steady state conditions. We also find that the introduction of mixotrophs tends to decrease the primary production based on uptake of nitrogen from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, but that this decrease may be compensated for by mixotrophic primary production based upon organic nitrogen sources.},

abstract = {Marine microbes (<200 $\mu$m) contribute most of the living matter and carbon flow in the Southern Ocean, yet the factors that control the composition and function of these microbial communities are not well understood. To determine the importance of microbial grazers in controlling microbial abundance, we determined microbial standing stocks and rates of herbivory and bacterivory in relation to the physical environment off East Antarctica during the Baseline Research on Oceanography, Krill and the Environment: West (BROKE-West) survey, which covered waters from the Polar Front to the coast between 30 and 80°E. Concentrations of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) (∼2 to 20 $\mu$m), microzooplankton (∼20 to 200 $\mu$m), bacteria, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) were determined and the growth and grazing mortality of phytoplankton and bacteria were estimated using the grazing dilution technique at 22 sites along the survey. Results showed that microzooplankton and HNF consumed on average 52% of bacterial production d-1 and 62% primary production d-1 but consumed >100% d-1 at the western ice-edge sites. Rates of bacterivory ranged from 0.4 - 2.6 d-1 and were correlated with bacterial concentrations, bacterial growth rates and longitude. Rates were highest in the eastern-most part of the survey, which was sampled last, reflecting the transition along the successional continuum toward a respiration-based, senescent, microbial community. Rates of herbivory ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 d-1 and were correlated with concentrations of microzooplankton and HNF combined, rates of phytoplankton growth, and latitude. Rates were highest at southern ice edge sites where concentrations of prey (as represented by Chl a) and microzooplankton were also highest. Cluster analysis of the concentrations of marine microbes and their rates of growth and grazing mortality identified 5 groups of sample sites that conveniently summarised the variability in the composition and function of the microbial community. Cluster groups differentiated between low Chl a (∼0.3 $\mu$g l-1) open ocean Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) communities; and high Chl a (∼2.4 $\mu$g l-1) ice-associated coastal blooms at various stages between bloom formation and senescence. This partitioning of cluster groups can be used to determine spatial and temporal patterns of carbon transfer by the microbial loop within the BROKE-West survey area. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {We investigate the influence of mixotrophy on the dynamical properties of a six-population model of a three–trophic level Southern Ocean ecosystem. We find that including mixotrophic interactions between the lowest trophic level populations can significantly influence the dynamics of the highest trophic level populations, and in extreme cases lead to extinctions. Significantly, not only is the strength of the mixotrophic interaction important, it matters how it is included in the model, as a specialist or generalist grazer. We note in particular that the generalist formulation is inappropriate for “green” mixotrophs that fuel the majority of their growth by photosynthesis. The model can have complicated dynamics when subject to large amplitude, regular forcing, suggesting the sea ice—salps link may be obfuscated by endogenous population oscillations. Further, we observe that constructing the model within the Conservative Normal framework allows insights into the bifurcation behaviour of the model.},

Here we present an analysis of a unique set of DNA metabarcoding samples from the western Weddell Sea sampled throughout the whole water column and across five water masses with different characteristics and different origin. We focus on factors affecting the distribution of planktonic pico-nano eukaryotes and observe an ecological succession of eukaryotic communities as the water masses move away from the surface and as oxygen becomes depleted with time. At the beginning of this succession, in the photic zone, algae, bacteriovores, and predators of small eukaryotes dominate the community, while another community develops as the water sinks deeper, mostly composed of parasitoids (syndinians), mesoplankton predators (radiolarians), and diplonemids. The strongly correlated distribution of syndinians and diplonemids along the depth and oxygen gradients suggests their close ecological link and moves us closer to understanding the biological role of the latter group in the ocean ecosystem. DNA metabarcoding of pelagic protists in the Weddell Sea expands our understanding of their ecological role and interactions throughout the water column.},

abstract = {The classic view of polar ocean foodwebs emphasizes large predators sustained by energy and material flow through short, efficient diatom-krill-predator food chains. Bacterial activity is generally low in cold polar waters compared to that at lower latitudes. This view appears to be changing, with new studies of microbial foodwebs in Arctic and Antarctic oceans. We characterized bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community diversity and composition from 2 depths (near surface and below the euphotic zone) at 4 sites, including the inshore and offshore, and north and south corners of a sampling grid along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We detected up to 2-fold higher richness in microbial eukaryotes at surface and deep inshore northern stations as compared to southern stations, but offshore northern and southern stations revealed either no trend or higher richness at depth in the south. In contrast, bacterial and archaeal richness showed no significant differences either inshore or offshore at northern versus southern extents, but did vary with depth. Archaea were virtually absent in summer surface waters, but were present in summer deep and winter surface samples. Overall, winter bacterial and archaeal assemblages most closely resembled summer sub-euphotic zone assemblages, reflecting well-established seasonal patterns of water column turnover and stratification that result in an isolated layer of 'winter water' below the euphotic zone. Inter-domain heterotroph-phototroph interactions were evident from network analysis. The WAP is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth. Our results provide a baseline against which future change in microbial communities may be assessed.},

abstract = {1. Grazing and photosynthetic contributions to the carbon balance of planktonic, mixotrophic cryptophytes in Lakes Fryxell and Hoare in the Taylor Valley, Antarctica were measured during November and December 2000. 2. The cryptophytes never became entirely photosynthetic, although carbon derived from grazing decreased in December. Individual grazing rates ranged between 5.28 and 10.08 bacteria cell-1 day-1 in Lake Fryxell and 0.36-11.76 bacteria cell-1 day-1 in Lake Hoare. Grazing rates varied temporally and with depth in the water column. In Lake Fryxell, which is a meromictic lake, highest grazing occurred just above the chemocline. Individual photosynthetic rates ranged from 0.23 to 1.35 pg C cell-1 h-1 in Lake Fryxell and 0.074 to 1.08 pg C cell-1 h-1 in Lake Hoare. 3. Carbon acquisition by the cryptophyte community gained through grazing ranged between 8 and 31% during November in Lake Fryxell, dropping to between 2 and 24% in December. In Lake Hoare grazing contributed 12-21% of the community carbon budget in November and 1-28% in December. Around 4% of the carbon acquired from grazing and photosynthesis was remineralised through respiration. 4. Mixotrophy is probably a major survival strategy for cryptophytes in the extreme lakes of the Dry Valleys, because perennial ice-cover severely limits light penetration to the water column, whereas these phytoflagellates are not normally mixotrophic in lower latitude lakes. The evidence suggests that mixotrophy may be a mechanism for supplementing the carbon budget, as well as a means of acquiring nutrients for growth.},

abstract = {Remote-sensing models based on total (bb) and particle (bbp) backscattering are proposed for estimating phytoplankton size-structure characteristics over the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) waters. It is hypothesized that phytoplankton assemblages with larger cells will have lower spectral bb and bbp slopes ($\gamma$). Likewise, a higher concentrations of total chlorophyll a (chlT) will coincide with larger phytoplankton cells. Values of [image omitted], derived from satellite and in situ remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) measurements were matched up with field determinations of chlorophyll a concentration fractions (chl(gt;;20$\mu$m) and chl(0.45-20$\mu$m)) collected between 1997 and 2006 as part of the Palmer-LTER project. Functionalities between in situ measurements of [image omitted] and chlorophyll a fractions were also investigated. A consistent inverse relationship between chl(>20$\mu$m)/chlT and $\gamma$ (bb and bbp) values was found and verified with two approaches: spatial matchup of satellite monthly composites and time-space matchup of photosynthetic pigment markers. Based on satellite data, a [image omitted] value of 1.668 was a fair predictor to differentiate WAP waters dominated by 'large' (chl(>20$\mu$m)/chlT≥0.5, [image omitted]) vs 'small' (chl(>20$\mu$m)/chlT>0.5, [image omitted]) phytoplankton cells. A significant negative linear relationship between 19′-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, fucoxanthin, and [image omitted] values suggest that Phaeocystis aggregates and large diatoms (>20 $\mu$m) would explain most of the chl(>20$\mu$m)/ chlT-$\gamma$ variability. No relationships were evident between chlT values and $\gamma$ values. Although our results cannot be generalized to other oceanic regions, this work is the first to provide evidence about the significant influence of phytoplankton size distributions on spectral backscattering of WAP waters. Furthermore, and based on chlorophyll a fraction analysis, it was the >20 $\mu$m phytoplankton cells that were responsible for such $\gamma$ variations seen on satellite and in situ values.},

abstract = {The west Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) region has undergone significant changes in temperature and seasonal ice dynamics since the mid-twentieth century, with strong impacts on the regional ecosystem, ocean chemistry and hydrographic properties. Changes to these long-term trends of warming and sea ice decline have been observed in the 21st century, but their consequences for ocean physics, chemistry and the ecology of the high-productivity shelf ecosystem are yet to be fully established. The WAP shelf is important for regional krill stocks and higher trophic levels, whilst the degree of variability and change in the physical environment and documented biological and biogeochemical responses make this a model system for how climate and sea ice changes might restructure high-latitude ecosystems. Although this region is arguably the best-measured and best-understood shelf region around Antarctica, significant gaps remain in spatial and temporal data capable of resolving the atmosphere-ice-ocean-ecosystem feedbacks that control the dynamics and evolution of this complex polar system. Here we summarise the current state of knowledge regarding the key mechanisms and interactions regulating the physical, biogeochemical and biological processes at work, the ways in which the shelf environment is changing, and the ecosystem response to the changes underway. We outline the overarching cross-disciplinary priorities for future research, as well as the most important discipline-specific objectives. Underpinning these priorities and objectives is the need to better define the causes, magnitude and timescales of variability and change at all levels of the system. A combination of traditional and innovative approaches will be critical to addressing these priorities and developing a co-ordinated observing system for the WAP shelf, which is required to detect and elucidate change into the future.},

abstract = {Measurements of 230Th, 14C, 210Pb and 234Th activities were made on sediment cores collected along a N-S transect exhibiting a gradient in annual sea-ice duration off the West Antarctic Peninsula. The resultant data were used to evaluate the effects of regional warming on particle flux reaching the seabed on timescales from millennial to seasonal. Shelf samples were collected at five stations, over three cruises, between February 2008 and March 2009, as part of the FOODBANCS2 Project. Sea-ice conditions (the number of days ice-free prior to core collection) were evaluated at the five stations to understand the relationship between ice abundance and particle/radionuclide flux. Based on the millennial tracer 14C, rates of sediment accumulation along the peninsula decrease southward, consistent with the observed sea-ice gradient. 230Th data provide additional evidence on millennial timescales that sediment focusing (i.e., lateral transport) occurs to a greater extent in the northern reaches of the study area compared to the southernmost stations. The distribution of steady-state, 210Pb flux to the seabed (representing centurial trends) displays a similar trend to 14C, showing higher radionuclide/particle flux in the northern study area (where sea-ice duration is diminished) and lower flux southward as sea-ice duration increases. Additionally, 210Pb data suggest that lateral transport plays an important role in the sediment distributions of this radiotracer on hundred-year timescales, which is explainable by the relatively short circulation times of peninsular waters relative to 210Pb's half-life. On seasonal and annual time scales, the distribution of steady-state 234Th flux to the seabed shows an increase in radionuclide flux at the southernmost stations. This increase in radionuclide flux on seasonal and annual time scales is consistent with the warming trend along the peninsula and the reduction in sea-ice duration over the past decade. A significant statistical relationship, however, could not be established between annual sea-ice free days and 234Th-derived particle flux to the seabed. The fluxes/distributions of long-lived particle-reactive tracers (14C, 230Th, and 210Pb) on the West Antarctic Peninsula shelf appear to be controlled primarily by the long-term pattern of increasing annual sea-ice duration in the southward direction, whereas the fluxes of the short-lived tracer (234Th) are consistent with the more recent decreases in sea-ice duration (associated with climate change) that have occurred over the past decade, primarily in the southern West Antarctic Peninsula stations.},

abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a rapidly changing region with receding sea-ice cover. This region generally has increased phytoplankton productivity on the continental slope with a decrease observed in off-shelf waters located further northward. This study aims to improve the understanding of the distribution of iron (Fe) in this climatically important oceanic region during early sea-ice retreat, as well as the impact of receding ice cover on Fe concentrations and the importance of Fe and its sources at the beginning of the phytoplankton growth season. Five ocean transects were sampled along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (Pal-LTER) grid with an additional oceanward extension to access off-shelf waters during the austral spring (October and November) of 2014. High Fe inputs into the entire water column from ice melt as well as from sediments increased dissolved Fe (DFe) and total dissolvable Fe (TDFe) concentrations across the shelf (off-shelf DFe: 0.38 ± 0.30 nmol/L and TDFe: 2.23 ± 2.95 nmol/L versus shelf DFe: 1.54 ± 1.38 nmol/L and TDFe: 19.47 ± 23.82 nmol/L). The combination of meteoric meltwater and shallow sedimentary sources is strongest over the shelf and increased landward towards the WAP. Additionally, a winter sea-ice formation signature was detected in inner shelf waters that appeared to contribute to DFe concentrations. Relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) that flows onto the shelf through troughs is likely modified by non-reductive sedimentary input of Fe into the water column. The increase in Fe concentrations in WAP waters in early spring could trigger enhanced phytoplankton productivity across the shelf, although the highest productivity levels were observed in off-shelf waters, likely related to improved light conditions following receding sea-ice cover. The relatively high productivity levels in WAP off-shelf waters are presumably caused by two factors: (1) supply from below, and (2) the transport of Fe from the shelf to the off-shelf region. However, 80–90% of Fe introduced into shelf waters was removed from the upper water column prior to reaching off-shelf waters, reducing the influence of the coastal Fe source. Low concentrations of DFe (0.24 ± 0.26 nmol/L) in off-shelf waters (upper 100 m) of the WAP coincide with relatively elevated chlorophyll a concentrations (0.66 ± 0.56 $\mu$g/L), implying that uptake of available DFe had already occurred prior to sampling. Our results imply that the horizontal supply of DFe from the shelf as well as total DFe supply into the surface mixed layer might not be sufficiently high to support productivity in the off-shelf waters of the WAP, underlining the development of an Fe deficit early in the growth season.},

abstract = {The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program seeks to obtain a comprehensive understanding of various components of the Antarctic marine ecosystem-the assemblage of plants, microbes, animals, ocean, and sea-ice south of the Antarctic Polar Front. A central hypothesis of the Palmer LTER is that the seasonal and interannual variability of sea ice affects all levels of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, from the timing and magnitude of seasonal primary production to the breeding success and survival of apex predators. In the context of this high-latitude ecosystem we use satellite imagery to examine physical forcing and possible mechanisms influencing the distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the region to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. We evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of pigment biomass (estimated as chlorophyll-a concentrations using SeaWiFS data) in response to the spatial and temporal variability of sea-ice extent (estimated from passive microwave satellite data). While the ocean-color data record is relatively short (7 years) and contains high interannual variability, there are persistent spatial patterns of phytoplankton biomass that indicate important regional-scale physical mechanisms including: the marginal ice zone and its impact on the mixed-layer depth, the timing of spring sea-ice retreat, the importance of the southern Antarctic Circumpolar front, and teleconnections with sub-polar regions. The SeaWIFS imagery presented here provides the most complete synoptic space/time views of phytoplankton biomass within this region to date. These observations suggest that the southern Antarctic Circumpolar front may have a more profound influence on the western Antarctic Peninsula ecosystem than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {During January and February 2017 massive phytoplankton blooms (chlorophyll > 15 mg m−3) were registered in surface waters within two bays in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). Reflecting these intense blooms, surface waters exhibited high pH (up to 8.4), low pCO2 (< 175 µatm) and low nitrate concentrations (down to 1.5 µM). These summer phytoplankton blooms consisted mainly of diatoms and were associated with the presence of shallow, surface freshwater plumes originating from glacier-melt outflow which contributed both to stratification and to iron supply, thus facilitating pronounced nitrate and CO2 drawdown. These findings suggest that with future increases in freshwater discharge around the WAP, phytoplankton blooms in the northern WAP may become more dominated by large cells, resembling the blooms occurring further south along the Peninsula. Fresher surface waters enhanced water column stability in both bays, enabling phytoplankton populations to attain high growth rates. Phytoplankton was observed to double their biomass in 2.3 days, consistent with the high net primary production rates recorded in both bays (1.29–8.83 g C m−2 d−1). Phytoplankton growth rates showed a direct mechanistic relationship with changes in water column stability, suggesting that this is a main driver of primary productivity in near-shore Antarctic coastal ecosystems, which agrees with previous findings. After wind induced mixing, the organic matter produced within both bays did not settle inside them, suggesting that it was laterally advected out of the bays. Thus, we hypothesize that highly productive near-shore bay areas in Antarctica may supply organic matter to oceanic waters.},

abstract = {The temporal and spatial variability of phytoplankton size structure of waters west of the Antarctica Peninsula (WAP) was investigated between 1997 and 2006. Time series of satellite-derived (phytoplankton size structure index or $\gamma$bbp, chlorophyll a concentration or chlT, and sea-ice extent) and shipboard (temperature, salinity, nutrients, and mixed-layer depth) variables were generated during spring-summer in slope, middle shelf and inshore waters and analyzed in relation to atmospheric anomalies (El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, ENSO, and Southern Annular Mode, SAM). The sampling design included stations north (northern, 62°S) and within (central and southern, 64-68°S) the Pal-LTER (Palmer Long Term Ecological Research) study site. It is hypothesized that contribution of 'small' phytoplankton (<20 $\mu$m) has increased in the last decade in WAP waters due the ongoing regional climate change. Relationships between $\gamma$bbp, the spectral slope of particle backscattering, and environmental parameters were explored based on non-parametric trends (Mann-Kendall test) and cross-correlation coefficients (Spearman matrix). Three types of temporal patterns were detected in satellite-derived phytoplankton size distributions: (1) inter-annual variations of spring-summer $\gamma$bbp related to monthly sea-ice extent, (2) abrupt transitions toward dominance of 'small' (<20 $\mu$m) phytoplankton cells (high $\gamma$bbp) and low chlT values (<1 mg m-3) during 1998 and 2003 summer seasons, and (3) positive or negative trends (decrease vs increase of mean cell size) in specific domains of central and northern stations. Temporal transitions in cell size coincided with a switch on ENSO and SAM anomalies as well as increase of heat content of shelf waters over the WAP region. The lack of offshore spring bloom and summer shelf bloom most likely explains the dominance of relative small phytoplankton cells during the 1998 and 2003 summer seasons. A greater frequency of southerly winds during spring and autumn is expected to favor the dominance of 'small' (<20 $\mu$m) phytoplankton cells over WAP waters. Conversely, the greater intensification of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current interaction with the WAP shelf-break during SAM+ years is expected to intensify topographically induced upwelling and favor the dominance of 'large' (>20 $\mu$m) phytoplankton cells on slope waters of central stations. The well-described 50-year warming trend in the Antarctic Peninsula has not resulted in a consistent trend in phytoplankton size structure, as originally hypothesized, but a mosaic of trends attributed to anomalous mesoscale changes of sea-ice extent and circulation patterns. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {We present results on phytoplankton and bacterial production and related hydrographic properties collected on nine annual summer cruises along the western Antarctic Peninsula. This region is strongly influenced by interannual variations in the duration and extent of sea ice cover, necessitating a decade-scale study. Our study area transitions from a nearshore region influenced by summer runoff from glaciers to an offshore, slope region dominated by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The summer bacterial assemblage is the product of seasonal warming and freshening following spring sea ice retreat and the plankton succession occurring in that evolving water mass. Bacterial production rates averaged 20mgCm -2d -1 and were a low (5%) fraction of the primary production (PP). There was significant variation in BP between regions and years, reflecting the variability in sea ice, chlorophyll and PP. Leucine incorporation was significantly correlated (r 2 ranging 0.2-0.7, p<0.001) with both chlorophyll and PP across depths, regions and years indicating strong phytoplankton-bacteria coupling. Relationships with temperature were variable, including positive, negative and insignificant relationships (r 2<0.2 for regressions with p<0.05). Bacterial production is regulated indirectly by variations in sea ice cover within regions and over years, setting the levels of phytoplankton biomass accumulation and PP rates; these in turn fuel BP, to which PP is coupled via direct release from phytoplankton or other less direct pathways. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, we examined the interannual variability of net community production (NCP) in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) using in situ O2/Ar-NCP estimates (2008–2014) and satellite data (SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua) from 1997 to 2014. We found that NCP generally first peaks offshore and follows sea-ice retreat from offshore to inshore. Annually integrated NCP (ANCP) displays an onshore-to-offshore gradient, with coastal and shelf regions up to 8 times more productive than offshore regions. We examined potential drivers of interannual variability in the ANCP using an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The EOF's first mode explains ∼50% of the variance, with high interannual variability observed seaward of the shelf break. The first principal component is significantly correlated with the day of sea-ice retreat (R = −0.58, p < 0.05), as well as the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate indices in austral spring. Although the most obvious pathway by which the day of sea-ice retreat influences NCP is by controlling light availability early in the growing season, we found that the effect of day of sea-ice retreat on NCP persists throughout the growing season, suggesting that additional controls, such as iron availability, are preconditioned or correlated to the day of sea-ice retreat.},

abstract = {Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis and microbial plankton dynamics of two lakes in the Kongsfjorden catchment of Spitzbergen (Svalbard Archipelago, 78°N) were investigated during the summer of 2000. One of the lakes (Tvillingvatnet) served as the water supply for the village of Ny {\AA}lesund. The other was a deeper, larger unnamed lake in the Ossian Sarsfjella reserve - named Lake OS in this study. Both lakes can be classified as oligotrophic on the basis of chlorophyll a and inorganic nutrient concentrations. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged between 0.33 and 1.65 $\mu$g l-1 in Tvillingvatnet and 0.2 and 0.3 $\mu$g l-1 in Lake OS. The phytoplankton was dominated by chrysophytes and cryptophytes, with the diatom Rhizosolenia and a number of dinoflagellate species. Rates of photosynthesis were typically low, between 24.5 $\mu$g and 1.0 mg l-1 day -1 in Tvillingvatnet (photosynthetic efficiency 0.004-0.26), and between 3.1 and 29.5 $\mu$g l-1 day -1 in Lake OS (photosynthetic efficiency 0.0019-0.0085). Among the phytoflagellates (PNAN) there were a number of mixotrophs which reached their peaks of abundance before other PNAN. Mixotrophy appeared to provide a competitive advantage. Grazing rates for the mixotroph Dinobryon ranged between 0.063 and 1.12 pg C cell -1 day-1 in Lake OS and between 0.22 and 1.11 pg cell -1 day-1 in Tvillingvatnet, with rates increasing between July and August. However, Dinobryon removed less than 1% of bacterial biomass day-1, while the heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) removed up to 28% of bacterial biomass day-1. Bacterial concentrations were low, with a maximum of 28.8×108 l-1 in Tvillingvatnet and 23.6×108 l-1 in Lake OS. Ciliated protozoan and rotifer diversity in the plankton was low.},

However, egg production and recruitment rates generally increased when feeding on mixotrophs, in P. grani on both N- and P-limited diets, and in C. typicus under P limitation. In general, P limitation influenced copepod physiology more than N depletion. Our results show that phagotrophy upgrades nutritional quality in nutrient-limited mixotrophs as prey for copepods compared to the strict autotrophic ones. These findings are among the first reported cases of copepod ingestion in the laboratory on actively feeding mixoplankton, and they highlight the importance of considering the trophic mode of the protist and the response by various zooplanktonic predators when attempting to understand the functioning of marine planktonic food webs.},

abstract = {We studied autotrophic and heterotrophic C metabolism during mixotrophic growth of Karlodinium micrum (Leadbeter et Dodge) Larsen (Dinophyceae) on prey Storeatula major (Cryptophyceae). Our goal was to determine the balance of autotrophy and heterotrophy that supports mixotrophic growth in K. micrum. Assimilation of inorganic 14C and 14C-labeled prey was used to separate the quantity and quality (i.e., lipid, polysaccharide and protein) of C obtained by autotrophy and heterotrophy, respectively. Growth rates ($\mu$) of mixotrophic K. micrum were 0.52-0.75 div.{\textperiodcentered}day -1, equal to or greater than the maximum autotrophic growth rate (0.55 div.{\textperiodcentered}day-1) of K. micrum. Autotrophy represented 27-69% of gross C uptake during mixotrophic growth. Cellular photosynthetic performance (PPcell, pg C cell-1{\textperiodcentered}day-1) was 24-52% lower during mixotrophic growth than during autotrophic growth of K. micrum. Mixotrophic K. micrum assimilated 16% less photosynthate as protein compared to autotrophic K. micrum, while protein was the major net assimilation product (52%) from ingested prey C. Growth efficiency (%GE) of mixotrophic cultures, based on both autotrophic and heterotrophic C sources, averaged 36 ± 2.9%, slightly lower than the 40-50% GE typical of purely autotrophic K. micrum, but higher C gains associated with heterotrophic feeding more than compensated for the decrease in %GE in mixotrophic K. micrum. We conclude that mixotrophic growth of K. micrum is dominated by heterotrophic metabolism, although photosynthesis continues at a lowered rate. This is consistent with a shift toward secondary production in plankton assemblages dominated by mixotrophically growing K. micrum. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006.

abstract = {The significance of microzooplankton as grazers in pelagic ecosystems has been established, yet relatively few studies of microzooplankton grazing, compared to that of macrozooplankton, have been conducted in the Southern Ocean. We report phytoplankton and bacterial growth and grazing mortality rates along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), a region of rapid climate change. Growth and grazing rates were determined by dilution experiments at select stations along the WAP in January of 2009 to 2011 and in the nearshore waters near Palmer Station in February and March 2011. Microzooplankton exerted higher grazing pressure on bacteria compared to phytoplankton along the WAP and also selectively grazed on smaller phytoplankton (picoautotrophs and nanophytoplankton) and on the more actively growing (high nucleic acid) bacterial cells. Among all phytoplankton size classes, growth rates ranged from undetectable (i.e. not significant; NS) to 0.99 d-1, grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.56 d-1, and microzooplankton removed <100% of daily phytoplankton production in all but one experiment. For high and low nucleic acid content bacteria, growth rates were NS to 0.95 d -1, and grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.43 d-1; microzooplankton often removed >100% of daily bacterial production. There was a significant (albeit weak) exponential relationship between temperature and phytoplankton mortality, although the range of experimental temperatures was small. The present study provides a reference point of microzooplankton grazing impact along the WAP in the summer and contributes valuable information to studies modeling the flow of carbon through the WAP food web, improving our ability to predict climate-induced changes in the WAP ecosystem. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2013.},

This was achieved by imposing four light levels (100%, 50%, 25%, and 10%) in the presence or absence of nutrient additions (0.1 mol NH 4Cl, 0.1 mol F6Na2Si, and 0.01 mol KH 2PO4 per day per mesocosm). The experimental treatments resulted in a broad range of chlorophyll a (Chl a) (0.31-93.5 $\mu$g Chl a L -1) and average primary production rates, while bacteria responded in a much narrower range of biomass (3-447 $\mu$g C L-1) and production (0.21-15.71 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1). Results confirm that bacteria-chlorophyll and bacterial production-primary production relationships in the Southern Ocean differ from the typical relationships applicable to aquatic ecosystems elsewhere. Bacteria respond to phytoplankton blooms, but they respond so weakly that bacterial production represents a small percentage of primary production (1-10%). Although other mechanisms might also contribute to the weak bacterial response to phytoplankton blooms, we demonstrate that the reason for it is likely the tight control of bacterial populations by their predators. Protist grazers are able to sustain faster growth rates in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean than are bacteria, thereby preventing bacteria from responding to phytoplankton blooms more forcibly. {\textcopyright} 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The coastal waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) are associated with large phytoplankton blooms dominated by large (>20 µm) diatoms however, nanoplankton (<20 µm) are also an important component of the food web. The dominant nanoflagellates in the WAP are cryptomonad algae. Using a twenty-year time series collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research program at the United States Palmer Research Station, we assessed long-term patterns and stability in the coastal phytoplankton communities in the WAP. There was significant interannual variability in the integrated water column chlorophyll a (chl-a) concentrations, which varied by a factor of 5 over the 20-year time series. There has been a significant positive increase in the seasonally integrated concentration of chl-a over the time series. The dominant phytoplankton were diatoms, with cryptophytes the second most abundant. Mixed flagellates also constituted a significant fraction of the chl-a but showed less interannual variability than diatoms and cryophytes. Peak phytoplankton biomass was observed in summer months, when monthly averaged wind speed was lower than in the fall and autumn. Cryptophytes were most abundant during the summer months (December-January) after the seasonal retreat of sea ice. While diatoms were observed over the full range of observed salinities 32–34.5) as well as over the full range of in situ temperatures (−1.5 to 2.5 °C), the cryptophyte populations were observed in locations with lower salinity 32.5–33.75) and colder water (−1 to 1 °C). Environmental factors that favored a shallower seasonal mixed layer resulted in larger diatom blooms compared to the other phytoplankton taxa. During summer with lower phytoplankton biomass, a larger proportion of the chlorophyll a was associated with cryptophytes. These results demonstrate that continued temperature changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula will result in changes in phytoplankton concentration and community composition, which has significant ramifications for the food web.},

abstract = {Multi-year satellite records indicate an asymmetric spatial pattern in the summer bloom in the Northern Ross Sea, with the largest blooms over the shallows of Pennell Bank compared to Mawson Bank. In 2010–2011, high-resolution spatiotemporal in situ sampling focused on these two banks to better understand factors contributing to this pattern. Dissolved and particulate Fe profiles suggested similar surface water depletion of dissolved Fe on both banks. The surface sediments and velocity observations indicate a more energetic water column over Mawson Bank. Consequently, the surface mixed layer over Pennell Bank was more homogeneous and shallower. Over Mawson Bank we observed a thicker more homogeneous bottom boundary layer resulting from stronger tidal and sub-tidal currents. These stronger currents scour the seafloor resulting in sediments less likely to release additional sedimentary iron. Estimates of the quantum yield of photosynthesis and the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance response were lower over Mawson Bank, indicating higher iron stress over Mawson Bank. Overall, the apparent additional sedimentary source of iron to, and longer surface residence time over Pennell Bank, as well as the reduced fluxes from the more isolated bottom mixed layer over Mawson Bank, sustain the observed asymmetric pattern across both banks.},

The experimental treatments resulted in a broad range of chlorophyll a (Chl a) (0.31-93.5 $\mu$g Chl a L -1) and average primary production rates, while bacteria responded in a much narrower range of biomass (3-447 $\mu$g C L-1) and production (0.21-15.71 $\mu$g C L-1 d-1). Results confirm that bacteria-chlorophyll and bacterial production-primary production relationships in the Southern Ocean differ from the typical relationships applicable to aquatic ecosystems elsewhere. Bacteria respond to phytoplankton blooms, but they respond so weakly that bacterial production represents a small percentage of primary production (1-10%). Although other mechanisms might also contribute to the weak bacterial response to phytoplankton blooms, we demonstrate that the reason for it is likely the tight control of bacterial populations by their predators. Protist grazers are able to sustain faster growth rates in the cold waters of the Southern Ocean than are bacteria, thereby preventing bacteria from responding to phytoplankton blooms more forcibly. {\textcopyright} 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Bacterivory among small (≤20 $\mu$m) phytoflagellates (SP) is increasingly recognized as a globally relevant phenomenon, impacting a wide range of aspects from primary production levels to marine fisheries. However, to correctly parametrize mixotrophic SP in biogeochemical and food web models, a better understanding of the magnitude and regulation of in situ SP feeding is urgently needed. Current methods to determine SP bacterivory in the field may introduce biases by treating these organisms as equivalent to heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF). In the present case study we experimentally tested two generally employed assumptions of such studies: (A) bacterivory rates of the whole SP community and of distinct SP groups remain constant over 'short' time scales (hours to a day) and (B) SP community ingestion rates approximate the average ingestion rate of all feeding individuals. Food vacuole markers (acidotropic probes), were applied along the diel cycle at three stations in December 2015, and May and June 2016. In December and June, surrogate prey (fluorescently labeled bacteria) were used in parallel at one sampling station. Sampling at different times of day produced an up to fourfold difference in estimates of SP daily bacterivorous impact. In contrast, daily bacterivory estimates for HNF remained constant in almost all cases. The perceived principal SP bacterivorous groups also shifted strongly. As an example, picoeukaryotes dominated total SP bacterivory in daylight hours but completely ceased to feed at night. Finally, a large fraction of the SP community was not feeding at all time points tested. This lead to significant errors in estimated ingestion rates determined using the whole SP community, being up to 16 times lower than those determined solely for actively feeding mixotrophic SP. Overall, this case study indicates that applying the two commonly used premises outlined above can introduce significant biases and considerably alter our perception of mixotrophy in a given system.},

abstract = {Polar marine ecosystems are characterized by low water temperatures, sea ice cover, and extreme annual variation in solar irradiance and primary productivity. A review of the available information from the Arctic suggests that mixotrophy (i.e., the combination of photosynthetic and phagotrophic modes of nutrition in one cell) is wide spread among plankton. In the central Arctic Ocean (AO) in summer, mixotrophic flagellates such as Micromonas and Dinobryon can account for much of bacterivory. Planktonic ciliates with acquired phototrophy form the bulk of microzooplankton biomass in both the ultra-oligotrophic deep basins of AO and its productive shelf seas. With the exception of the diatom bloom in the marginal ice zone, mixotrophic ciliates often dominate total chlorophyll in the mixed layer in summer taking advantage of the 24-h insolation. Their relatively high growth rates at low temperatures indicate that they are an important component of primary and secondary production. The key Arctic copepod species preferentially feed on chloroplast-bearing ciliates, which form an important link in the planktonic food web. The limited available year round data indicate that mixotrophic plankton persist in the water column during the long polar winter when irradiance is low or absent and ice cover further reduces light penetration. These observations suggest that at high latitudes an alternative food web based on mixotrophy may dominate the pelagic lower food web during much of the year.},

The drawdown of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate per mole of phosphate and the rate of new production by diatoms are much lower than that measured for P. antarctica.

Up to 47% of the P. gelidicola population ingested fluorescently labeled prey (FLP). Ingestion rates varied with depth. In January 1997 and November 1999, maximum P. gelidicola ingestion rates of 6.95 and 0.79 FLP{\textperiodcentered}cell -1{\textperiodcentered}h-1, respectively, were measured at the chemocline (6-8 m) where a deep chl maximum composed of phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN DCM), predominantly P. gelidicola, persisted all year. During the summers of 1997 and 1999, the grazing P. gelidicola community removed between 0.4% and approximately 16% of in situ bacterial biomass, equivalent to between 4% and >100% of in situ bacterial production. Because of their higher abundance, the community clearance rates of HNAN in Ace Lake generally exceeded those of P. gelidicola, but HNAN removed approximately only 3%-4% of bacterial biomass, equivalent to between 28% and 32% of bacterial production. Pyramimonas gelidicola growth rates were highest at the PNAN DCM concomitant with the highest ingestion rates. It is estimated that during the summer P. gelidicola can derive up to 30% of their daily carbon requirements from bacterivory at the PNAN DCM. This study confirms mixotrophy as an important strategy by which planktonic organisms can survive in extreme, polar, lacustrine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Despite the relevance of high latitude oceans to models and budgets of biogenic carbon, and the central role of heterotrophic microbes in global biogeochemical cycles, the patterns of energy flow through the lower food web in polar regions are poorly understood. To assess bacteria-based food webs in polar regions, the distribution, growth, and respiration and grazing losses of bacteria must be characterized. We report on the results of a seasonal (late winter through late summer) study of protist grazing in both Resolute Bay, Northwest Territories, Canadian Arctic and McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, and summarize the literature on the relations between the growth and grazing mortality of polar bacterioplankton. Bacterial abundance varied 5-fold in the Arctic and 25-fold in the Antarctic. Average bacterial growth rates ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 d-1. During comparable seasons, bacterial abundance was 2- to 3-fold higher and growth rates were 2- to 3-fold lower in the Antarctic than the Arctic. When grazing occurred, microzooplankton consumed nearly all of the local bacterial production. Grazing losses of bacteria were negligible immediately before and after the phytoplankton bloom. We propose that at these times, bacterioplankton were nutrient limited and protists were predominantly herbivorous. Protozoan grazers appear to alternate between bacterivorous and herbivorous nutritional modes as prey fields change in response to the seasonal progression in submarine irradiance and concentration of dissolved nutrients. The timing and magnitude of the phytoplankton bloom and the duration of the post-bloom period exert a significant influence on the flux of bacterioplankton carbon through microzooplankton and ultimately the coupling of the microbial and metazoan food webs.},

abstract = {Phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton (PNAN, HNAN; 2-20 $\mu$m protists) and microplankton (PMIC, HMIC; 20-200 $\mu$m protists and micrometazoa) are major taxa involved in partitioning carbon and energy within the pelagic food web. In the Ross Sea, Antarctica, plankton biomass appears to be controlled by the seasonal recession of the sea ice and the formation of the Ross Sea polynya during the short austral spring-summer period. During four cruises in 1996-1997 within the southern Ross Sea as part of the US JGOFS program, we determined the abundances and biomasses of phototrophic and heterotrophic nanoplankton and microplankton primarily along a transect at 76°30′S. The colonial prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica (excluding mucus carbon) contributed significantly to community structure during both non-bloom and bloom periods (∼25% and 90%, respectively, of microbial biomass). However, shifts occurred both seasonally and spatially between a diatom/heterotrophic dinoflagellate and a colonial P. antarctica-dominated assemblage. While nanoplankton biomass varied <50% during any particular cruise, PNAN and HNAN biomass ranged more than three orders of magnitude among the four cruises (0.1-359 and 1.5-268mmolCm-2, respectively). Cruise averages of PMIC biomass ranged from 2.5 to 530 mmol C m-2, and a maximum biomass of 1530 mmol Cm-2 was observed during the bloom of colonial P. antarctica in summer. Average heterotrophic biomass was <30% of the total microbial biomass (excluding bacteria) from early austral spring through summer. This value rose to ≅87% in autumn following the decline and disappearance of P. antarctica. The contribution of total nano- and microplankton biomass to POC in the upper 60m over the three sampled seasons varied from 7% to 52.4% with an overall average of 21.8% for all four cruises which is comparable to contributions of these assemblages in other oceans even with the strong seasonal dominance of P. antarctica. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Biomass and feeding activity of protozoa were measured as well as the biomass of their potential prey - bacteria and phototrophic flagellates - along the 62°E meridian. The sampling grid extended from the Polar Frontal region to the Coastal and Continental Shelf Zone in late summer and to the ice edge in spring, crossing the Antarctic Divergence. Protozoan biomass, although low in absolute terms, contributed 30% and 20% to the total microbial biomass (bacteria, phytoplankton and protozoa) in early spring and late summer, respectively. Nanoprotozoa dominated the total protozoan biomass. The geographical and seasonal distribution of protozoan biomass was correlated with that of phototrophic flagellates. However, bacterial and phototrophic flagellate biomass were inversely correlated. Phototrophic flagellates dominated in the Sea Ice Zone whereas bacteria were predominant at the end of summer in the Polar Frontal region and Coastal and Continental Shelf Zone. Furthermore, bacteria were the most important component of the microbial community (57% of the total microbial biomass) in late summer. Phototrophic flagellates were ingested by both nano-and microprotozoa. In contrast, bacteria were only ingested by nanoprotozoa. Protozoa controlled up to 90% of the daily bacterial production over the period examined. The spring daily protozoan ingestion controlled more than 100% of daily phototrophic flagellate production. This control was less strong at the end of summer when protozoan grazing controlled 42% of the daily phototrophic flagellate production.},

Biomass and feeding activities of nanoprotozoa were measured, as well as the biomass of their potential prey bacteria and phototrophic flagellates-on the 6°W meridian in the Southern Ocean along three repetitive transects between 47 and 60°South from October to November 1992. On average, nanoprotozooplankton biomass accounted for 77% of the combined biomass of bacteria and phototrophic flagellates, and was dominated by dinoflagellates and flagellates smaller than 5 $\mu$m. As a general trend, low protozoan biomass of 2 mg C m-3 was typical of the ice covered area, while significantly higher biomasses culminating at 15 mg C m-3 were recorded at the Polar Front. Biomasses of bacteria and total phytoplankton were distributed accordingly, with larger values at the Polar Front. Phototrophic flagellates did not show any geographical trend. No seasonal trend could be identified in the Marginal Ice Zone and in the intermediate waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. On the other hand, at the Polar Front region a three-fold increase was observed within a 2-month period for nanoprotozooplankton biomass. Such a biomass increase was also detected for bacterioplankton and total phytoplankton biomass. Half-saturation constants and maximum specific ingestion of nanoprotozoan taxons feeding on bacteria and phototrophic flagellates were determined using the technique of fluorescent labelled bacteria (FLB) and algae (FLA) over a large range of prey concentrations. Maximum ingestion rates ranged between 0.002 and 0.015 h-1 for bactivorous nanoprotozoa and heterotrophic flagellates larger than 5 $\mu$m feeding on phototrophic flagellates. The markedly high maximum ingestion rates of 0.4 h-1 characterising nanophytoplankton ingestion by dinoflagellates evidenced the strong ability of dinoflagellates for feeding on nanophytoplankton. Daily ingestion rates were calculated from nanoprotozoan grazing parameters and carbon biomass of prey and predators. This indicated that nanoprotozoa ingestion of daily bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production in early spring ranged from 32 to 40%.},

abstract = {The western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) fjords, currently threatened by climate change, are known as high krill congregation areas, however, the primary productivity in relation to phytoplankton groups in these coastal areas remains uncertain. To test this, we studied the specific composition, diversity and cellular carbon content of phytoplankton communities in relation to primary production (PP) and growth rates in Andvord Bay, its connection to Gerlache Strait and a near station on the continental shelf during spring (2015) and autumn (2016). Based on the microscopic determination of the relative biomass of the different microalgal taxa we determined three main phytoplankton assemblages that differ in their composition, PP, growth, and spatial and temporal distribution: (1) an assemblage dominated by cryptophytes, with high biomass (59.2 ± 28.2 $\mu$gC L−1), intermediate PP (63.1 ± 32 mgC m−3 d−1), and low growth (0.2 ± 1.1 d−1) present in the inner part of the fjord during spring, and related to higher surface water temperatures; (2) an assemblage dominated by microplanktonic diatoms (mainly Odontella weissflogii) with intermediate biomass (40.1 ± 17.2 $\mu$gC L−1), high PP (151.2 ± 62.5 mgC m−3 d−1), and high growth (0.9 ± 1 d−1) present from the fjord mouth to the Gerlache Strait waters during spring and in shelf waters during autumn, related to high irradiance and microzooplankton biomass; and (3) an assemblage dominated by dinoflagellates, mainly small gymnodinioids (< 15 $\mu$m long), with low biomass (3.5 ± 3.5 $\mu$gC L−1), low PP (6.9 ± 5.1 mgC m−3 d−1), and intermediate growth (0.5 ± 0.6 d−1) present in the whole fjord and the Gerlache Strait during autumn and infrequently during spring, related to high meltwater fraction. During both seasons, the highest phytoplankton biomass, richness and productivity in Andvord Bay was located in a frontal area at the fjord's mouth. Overall, the results of this study support the notion that WAP fjords are highly productive, highlighting the role of microplanktonic diatom as the main organic carbon producers, even when they occur in low abundances, due to their photosynthetic potential and higher Carbon-to-Chlorophyll a ratio. Our results, together with previous phytoplankton growth rates measured in the WAP nearshore waters from King George Island to Marguerite Bay, are higher than those measured on the WAP shelf and in the Ross Sea suggesting micro- and macronutrient enrichment from glacial melt maintains high productivity throughout the growth season in fjords. Our results support the hypothesis that climate change could highly affect the coastal WAP ecosystems by changing the balance between more productive phytoplankton assemblages (diatoms) to considerably less productive phytoplankton assemblages (cryptophytes).},

abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a rapidly changing region with receding sea-ice cover. This region generally has increased phytoplankton productivity on the continental slope with a decrease observed in off-shelf waters located further northward. This study aims to improve the understanding of the distribution of iron (Fe) in this climatically important oceanic region during early sea-ice retreat, as well as the impact of receding ice cover on Fe concentrations and the importance of Fe and its sources at the beginning of the phytoplankton growth season. Five ocean transects were sampled along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (Pal-LTER) grid with an additional oceanward extension to access off-shelf waters during the austral spring (October and November) of 2014. High Fe inputs into the entire water column from ice melt as well as from sediments increased dissolved Fe (DFe) and total dissolvable Fe (TDFe) concentrations across the shelf (off-shelf DFe: 0.38 ± 0.30 nmol/L and TDFe: 2.23 ± 2.95 nmol/L versus shelf DFe: 1.54 ± 1.38 nmol/L and TDFe: 19.47 ± 23.82 nmol/L). The combination of meteoric meltwater and shallow sedimentary sources is strongest over the shelf and increased landward towards the WAP. Additionally, a winter sea-ice formation signature was detected in inner shelf waters that appeared to contribute to DFe concentrations. Relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) that flows onto the shelf through troughs is likely modified by non-reductive sedimentary input of Fe into the water column. The increase in Fe concentrations in WAP waters in early spring could trigger enhanced phytoplankton productivity across the shelf, although the highest productivity levels were observed in off-shelf waters, likely related to improved light conditions following receding sea-ice cover. The relatively high productivity levels in WAP off-shelf waters are presumably caused by two factors: (1) supply from below, and (2) the transport of Fe from the shelf to the off-shelf region. However, 80–90% of Fe introduced into shelf waters was removed from the upper water column prior to reaching off-shelf waters, reducing the influence of the coastal Fe source. Low concentrations of DFe (0.24 ± 0.26 nmol/L) in off-shelf waters (upper 100 m) of the WAP coincide with relatively elevated chlorophyll a concentrations (0.66 ± 0.56 $\mu$g/L), implying that uptake of available DFe had already occurred prior to sampling. Our results imply that the horizontal supply of DFe from the shelf as well as total DFe supply into the surface mixed layer might not be sufficiently high to support productivity in the off-shelf waters of the WAP, underlining the development of an Fe deficit early in the growth season.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton production controls the transfer of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean through the biological carbon pump, facilitating the sequestration of carbon dioxide and thus, contributing to the regulation of global climate. In the Southern Ocean, a high-nutrient low-chlorophyll region, productivity is limited by micronutrients including iron. The limiting role of light is also important, especially in the context of Southern Ocean phytoplankton adaptation to the low-iron conditions. To investigate the relative dominance of iron and light limitation on phytoplankton growth, we conducted a series of incubation experiments during a 2019 summer research voyage off East Antarctica. Our results show that, while light was the primary limiting factor of phytoplankton growth, iron addition became favourable for growth under high light conditions. This supports similar findings from laboratory (Strzepek et al., 2019) and field experiments in the Ross Sea (Alderkamp et al., 2019) and provides a new insight from a different region of the Southern Ocean, at a later stage of the austral summer. Similar results have previously been documented in larger diatoms, and here we provide evidence that it is also true for smaller cells. Our findings add to the body of knowledge regarding iron and light limitation in the Southern Ocean, in a poorly sampled area, leading to a better understanding of how primary production will change in a future warming ocean.},

abstract = {The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) displays high but variable productivity and is also undergoing rapid change. Long-term studies of phytoplankton communities and primary production have suggested transient limitation by the micronutrient iron (Fe), but to date no data have been available to test this hypothesis. Here, we present the first spatially extensive, multi-year measurements of dissolved and particulate trace metals in surface waters to investigate the key sources and sinks of Fe in the central WAP shelf. Surface samples of dissolved and particulate metals were collected throughout the 700 × 200 km grid of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research program in three consecutive austral summers (2010 − 2012). Iron concentrations varied widely. Both dissolved and particulate Fe were high in coastal waters (up to 8 nmol kg− 1 and 42 nmol kg− 1, respectively). In contrast, very low Fe concentrations (< 0.1 nmol kg− 1) were widespread in mid- to outer-shelf surface waters, especially in the northern half of the sampling grid, suggesting possible Fe limitation of primary production on the shelf. Sea ice and dust inputs of Fe were minor, although their relative importance increased with distance from shore due to the larger near-shore sources. Sedimentary inputs were inferred from manganese distributions; these were more significant in the northern portion of the grid, and showed interannual variation in intensity. Overall, the interannual distribution of Fe was most closely correlated to that of meteoric water (glacial melt and precipitation). Although the Fe concentrations and relative contributions of dissolved and particulate Fe attributed to meltwater were variable throughout the sampling region, increasing glacial meltwater flux can be expected to increase the delivery of Fe to surface waters of the coastal WAP in the future.},

abstract = {We analyzed 20 years (1993-2013) of observations of dissolved inorganic macronutrients (nitrate, N; phosphate, P; and silicate, Si) and chlorophyll a (Chl) at Palmer Station, Antarctica (64.8°S, 64.1°W) to elucidate how large-scale climate and local physical forcing affect the interannual variability in the seasonal phytoplankton bloom and associated drawdown of nutrients. The leading modes of nutrients (N, P, and Si empirical orthogonal functions 1, EOF1) represent overall negative anomalies throughout growing seasons, showing a mixed signal of variability in the initial levels and drawdown thereafter (low-frequency dynamics). The second most common seasonal patterns of nitrate and phosphate (N and P EOF2) capture prolonged drawdown events during December-March, which are correlated to Chl EOF1. Si EOF2 captures a drawdown event during November-December, which is correlated to Chl EOF2. These different drawdown patterns are shaped by different sets of physical and climate forcing mechanisms. N and P drawdown events during December-March are influenced by the winter and spring Southern Annular Mode (SAM) phase, where nutrient utilization is enhanced in a stabilized upper water column as a consequence of SAM-driven winter sea ice and spring wind dynamics. Si drawdown during November-December is influenced by early sea ice retreat, where ice breakup may induce abrupt water column stratification and a subsequent diatom bloom or release of diatom cells from within the sea ice. Our findings underscore that seasonal nutrient dynamics in the coastal WAP are coupled to large-scale climate forcing and related physics, understanding of which may enable improved projections of biogeochemical responses to climate change.},

abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has experienced significant change over the last 50 years. Using a 24 year spatial time series collected by the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research programme, we assessed long-term patterns in the sea ice, upper mixed layer depth (MLD) and phytoplankton productivity. The number of sea ice days steadily declined from the 1980s until a recent reversal that began in 2008. Results show regional differences between the northern and southern regions sampled during regional ship surveys conducted each austral summer. In the southern WAP, upper ocean MLD has shallowed by a factor of 2. Associated with the shallower mixed layer is enhanced phytoplankton carbon fixation. In the north, significant interannual variability resulted in the mixed layer showing no trended change over time and there was no significant increase in the phytoplankton productivity. Associated with the recent increases in sea ice there has been an increase in the photosynthetic efficiency (chlorophyll a-normalized carbon fixation) in the northern and southern regions of the WAP. We hypothesize the increase in sea ice results in increased micronutrient delivery to the continental shelf which in turn leads to enhanced photosynthetic performance. This article is part of the theme issue 'The marine system of the West Antarctic Peninsula: status and strategy for progress in a region of rapid change'.},

abstract = {Historically, sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean has promoted increased phytoplankton primary production because of the greater open water area and a longer growing season. However, debate remains about whether primary production will continue to rise should sea ice decline further. Using an ocean color algorithm parameterized for the Arctic Ocean, we show that primary production increased by 57% between 1998 and 2018. Surprisingly, whereas increases were due to widespread sea ice loss during the first decade, the subsequent rise in primary production was driven primarily by increased phytoplankton biomass, which was likely sustained by an influx of new nutrients. This suggests a future Arctic Ocean that can support higher trophic-level production and additional carbon export.},

abstract = {Spatial and seasonal dynamics of microbial loop fluxes were investigated in contrasting productivity regimes in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. Observations carried out in late summer (February–March 2018; project MOBYDICK) revealed higher microbial biomasses and fluxes in the naturally iron-fertilized surface waters of Kerguelen island in comparison to surrounding off-plateau waters. Differences were most pronounced for bacterial heterotrophic production (2.3-fold), the abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF; 2.7-fold). Independent of site, grazing by HNF was the main loss process of bacterial production (80–100%), while virus-induced mortality was low (< 9%). Combining these results with observations from previous investigations during early spring and summer allowed us to describe seasonal patterns in microbial food web fluxes and to compare these to carbon export in the iron-fertilized and high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) Southern Ocean. Our data suggest an overall less efficient microbial food web during spring and summer, when respiration and viral lysis, respectively, represent important loss terms of bacterially-mediated carbon. In late summer, primary production is more efficiently transferred to bacterial biomass and HNF and thus available for higher trophic levels. These results provide a new insight into the seasonal variability and the quantitative importance of microbial food web processes for the fate of primary production in the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = {Measures of the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis ($\phi$ PSII) across an irradiance (E) gradient are an increasingly common physiological assay and alternative to traditional photosynthetic-irradiance (PE) assays. Routinely, the analysis and interpretation of these data are analogous to PE measurements. Relative electron transport rates (rETR = E ∞ $\phi$ PSII) are computed and fit to a PE curve to retrieve physiologically meaningful PE parameters. This widespread approach is statistically flawed as the response variable (rETR) is explicitly dependent on the predictor variable (E). Alternatively the E-dependency of $\phi$ PSII can be modeled directly while retaining the desired PE parameters by normalizing a given PE model to E. This manuscript presents a robust analysis in support of this alternative procedure. First, we demonstrate that scaling $\phi$ PSII to rETR unnecessarily amplifies the measurement error of $\phi$ PSII and using a Monte-Carlo analysis on synthetic data induces significantly higher uncertainty in computed PE parameters relative to modeling the E-dependency of $\phi$ PSII directly. Next a large dataset is simultaneously fitted to four PE models implemented in their original and E-normalized forms. Four statistical criteria used to evaluate the efficacy of nonlinear models demonstrate improved model fits and more precise PE parameters when data are modeled as E-dependent changes in $\phi$ PSII. The analysis presented in this manuscript clearly demonstrates that modeling the E-dependency of $\phi$ PSII directly should be the norm for interpreting active fluorescence measures. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Recent advances in evolutionary modelling and alignment methodology mean that today accurate and fast algorithms exist for aligning sequences with special features and incorporating structural and functional information. However, our reviewing experience and a recent study by Morrison (1) suggest that older and thus worse performing methods are predominantly used (especially in the communities of molecular systematics and experimental biology), and the resulting alignments are then curated manually. Most often, no clear biological reasoning is invoked during manual alignment, but rather its aesthetic qualities, as measured by eye are used. Such subjectivity is not consistent with core scientific principles. Although we recognize that methodological problems still exist, computerized alignment methods are currently more realistic and may account for a variety of factors. Here we argue that modern methodology is not utilized to its full potential, and thus discuss the advantages of certain recent methods so to encourage their greater use. We also suggest future directions for the further improvement of automatic alignment methods based upon disconnects of existing methods with underlying biological mechanisms.},

abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are the main nitrifiers which are well studied in natural environments, and AOA frequently outnumber AOB by orders especially in acidic conditions, making AOA the most promising ammonia oxidizers. The phylogeny of AOA revealed in related studies, however, often varied and hardly reach a consensus on functional phylotypes. The objective of this study was to compare ammonia-oxidizing communities by amoA gene and transcript based on both genomic DNA and RNA in extremely acidic forest soils (pH <4.5). Our results support the numerical and functional dominance of AOA over AOB in acidic soils as bacterial amoA gene and transcript were both under detection limits and archaeal amoA, in contrast, were abundant and responded to the fluctuations of environmental factors. Organic matter from tree residues was proposed as the main source of microbial available nitrogen, and the potential co-precipitation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) with soluble Al(3+) species in acidic soil matrix may further restrict the amount of nitrogen sources required by AOB besides NH3/NH4(+) equilibrium. Although AOA were better adapted to oligotrophic environments, they were susceptible to the toxicity of exchangeable Al(3+). Phylotypes affiliated to Nitrososphaera, Nitrososphaera sister group, and Nitrosotalea were detected by amoA gene and transcript. Nitrosotalea devantaerra and Nitrososphaera sister group were the major AOA. Compared to the genomic DNA data, higher relative abundances of Nitrososphaera and Nitrososphaera sister group were recognized in amoA transcript inferred AOA communities, where Nitrosotalea relative abundance was found lower, implying the functional activities of Nitrososphaera sister group and Nitrososphaera were easily underestimated and Nitrosotalea did not attribute proportionally to nitrification in extremely acidic soils. Further comparison of the different AOA community compositions and relative abundance of each phylotypes revealed by amoA genes and transcripts make it possible to identify the functional AOA species and assess their ecological role in extremely acidic soils.},

abstract = { Mixotrophy is increasingly recognized as an important and widespread nutritional strategy in various taxonomic groups ranging from protists to higher plants. We hypothesize that the availability of alternative carbon and energy sources during mixotrophy allows a switch to photoheterotrophic growth, where the photosynthetic apparatus mainly provides energy but not fixed carbon.  Because such a change in the function of the photosynthetic machinery is probably reflected in its composition, we compared the photosynthetic machinery in Ochromonas danica during autotrophic and mixotrophic growth.  Compared with autotrophic growth, the total pigmentation of O. danica was reduced during mixotrophic growth. Furthermore, the photosystem I (PSI):PSII ratio increased, and the cellular content of Rubisco decreased not only absolutely, but also relative to the content of PSII.  The changing composition of the photosynthetic apparatus indicates a shift in its function from providing both carbon and energy during photoautotrophy to mainly providing energy during mixotrophy. This preference for photoheterotrophic growth has interesting implications for the contribution of mixotrophic species to carbon cycling in diverse ecosystems.},

These broadly distributed primary producers belong to an anciently diverged sister clade to land plants. Although Micromonas isolates have high 18S ribosomal RNA gene identity, we found that genomes from two isolates shared only 90% of their predicted genes. Their independent evolutionary paths were emphasized by distinct riboswitch arrangements as well as the discovery of intronic repeat elements in one isolate, and in metagenomic data, but not in other genomes. Divergence appears to have been facilitated by selection and acquisition processes that actively shape the repertoire of genes that are mutually exclusive between the two isolates differently than the core genes.

abstract = {Prasinophytes are widespread marine green algae that are related to plants. Cellular abundance of the prasinophyte Micromonas has reportedly increased in the Arctic due to climate-induced changes. Thus, studies of these unicellular eukaryotes are important for marine ecology and for understanding Viridiplantae evolution and diversification. We generated evidence-based Micromonas gene models using proteomics and RNA-Seq to improve prasinophyte genomic resources. First, sequences of four chromosomes in the 22 Mb Micromonas pusilla (CCMP1545) genome were finished. Comparison with the finished 21 Mb genome of Micromonas commoda (RCC299; named herein) shows they share ≤8,141 of $\sim$10,000 protein-encoding genes, depending on the analysis method. Unlike RCC299 and other sequenced eukaryotes, CCMP1545 has two abundant repetitive intron types and a high percent (26 %) GC splice donors. Micromonas has more genus-specific protein families (19 %) than other genome sequenced prasinophytes (11 %). Comparative analyses using predicted proteomes from other prasinophytes reveal proteins likely related to scale formation and ancestral photosynthesis. Our studies also indicate that peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis enzymes have been lost in multiple independent events in select prasinophytes and plants. However, CCMP1545, polar Micromonas CCMP2099 and prasinophytes from other classes retain the entire PG pathway, like moss and glaucophyte algae. Surprisingly, multiple vascular plants also have the PG pathway, except the Penicillin-Binding Protein, and share a unique bi-domain protein potentially associated with the pathway. Alongside Micromonas experiments using antibiotics that halt bacterial PG biosynthesis, the findings highlight unrecognized phylogenetic complexity in PG-pathway retention and implicate a role in chloroplast structure or division in several extant Viridiplantae lineages. Extensive differences in gene loss and architecture between related prasinophytes underscore their divergence. PG biosynthesis genes from the cyanobacterial endosymbiont that became the plastid, have been selectively retained in multiple plants and algae, implying a biological function. Our studies provide robust genomic resources for emerging model algae, advancing knowledge of marine phytoplankton and plant evolution.},

In this project, mixotroph abundances determined using tracer ingestion in water and sea ice samples collected in the Ross Sea, Antarctica during the summer of 2011 were compared with data from the spring (Ross Sea) and fall (Arctic) to examine the impacts of bacterivory/mixotrophy. Mixotrophic nanoplankton (MNAN) were usually less abundant than heterotrophs, but consumed more of the bacterial standing stock per day due to relatively higher ingestion rates (1-7 bacteria mixotroph-1 h-1 vs. 0.1-4 bacteria heterotroph-1 h-1). Yet, even with these high rates observed in the Antarctic summer, mixotrophs appeared to have a smaller contribution to bacterivory than in the Antarctic spring. Additionally, putative mixotroph taxa were identified through incubation experiments accomplished with bromodeoxyuridine-labeled bacteria as food, immunoprecipitation (IP) of labeled DNA, and amplification and high throughput sequencing of the eukaryotic ribosomal V9 region. Putative mixotroph OTUs were identified in the IP samples by taxonomic similarity to known phototroph taxa. OTUs that had increased abundance in IP samples compared to the non-IP samples from both surface and chlorophyll maximum (CM) depths were considered to represent active mixotrophy and include ones taxonomically similar to Dictyocha, Gymnodinium, Pentapharsodinium, and Symbiodinium. These OTUs represent target taxa for isolation and laboratory experiments on triggers for mixotrophy, to be combined with qPCR to estimate their abundance, seasonal distribution and potential impact.},

Tracer experiments using fluorescently labeled bacteria (FLB) were conducted to enumerate MNF and determine their contribution to total chloroplastidic and total bacterivorous nanoflagellates. Absolute abundances of MNF were typically <200 ml -1 in plankton assemblages south of the Polar Front, but they comprised 8 to 42% and 3 to 25% of bacterivorous nanoflagellates in the water column and ice cores, respectively. Moreover, they represented up to 10% of all chloroplastidic nanoflagellates in the water column when the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica was blooming (up to 23% if P. antarctica, which did not ingest FLB, was excluded from calculations). In ice cores, MNF comprised 5 to 10% of chloroplastidic nanoflagellates. The highest proportions of MNF were found in some surface water samples and in plankton assemblages beneath ice, suggesting a potentially large effect as bacterial grazers in those locations. This study is the first to report abundances and distributions of mixotrophic flagellates in the Southern Ocean. The presence of MNF in every ice and water sample examined suggests that mixotrophy is an important alternative dietary strategy in this region. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Since the middle of the past century, the Western Antarctic Peninsula has warmed rapidly with a significant loss of sea ice but the impacts on plankton biodiversity and carbon cycling remain an open question. Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.},

abstract = {Although winter conditions play a major role in determining the productivity of the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) waters for the following spring and summer, a few studies have dealt with the seasonal variability of microorganisms in the WAP in winter. Moreover, because of regional warming, sea-ice retreat is happening earlier in spring, at the onset of the production season. In this context, this study describes the dynamics of the marine microbial community in the Melchior Archipelago (WAP) from fall to spring 2006. Samples were collected monthly to biweekly at four depths from the surface to the aphotic layer. The abundance and carbon content of bacteria, phytoplankton and microzooplankton were analyzed using flow cytometry and inverted microscopy, and bacterial richness was examined by PCR-DGGE. As expected, due to the extreme environmental conditions, the microbial community abundance and biomass were low in fall and winter. Bacterial abundance ranged from 1.2 to 2.8 × 105 cells ml-1 showing a slight increase in spring. Phytoplankton biomass was low and dominated by small cells (<2 $\mu$m) in fall and winter (average chlorophyll a concentration, Chl-a, of, respectively, 0.3 and 0.13 $\mu$g l-1). Phytoplankton biomass increased in spring (Chl-a up to 1.13 $\mu$g l-1), and, despite potentially adequate growth conditions, this rise was small and phytoplankton was still dominated by small cells (2-20 $\mu$m). In addition, the early disappearing of sea-ice in spring 2006 let the surface water exposed to ultraviolet B radiations (UVBR, 280-320 nm), which seemed to have a negative impact on the microbial community in surface waters. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Availability of dissolved iron and light are both regulating factors for primary productivity in high (macro)nutrient, low chlorophyll regions of the Southern Ocean. Here, using on-board iron/light incubation experiments conducted in 2015 in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, we show that irradiance limited significant phytoplankton growth (in chlorophyll-a and particulate organic carbon) north of the Polar Front (46 °S 08 °E), while iron addition resulted in growth stimulation even at low light levels in the Antarctic zone (65 °S 0 °E). The phytoplankton community in the Polar Frontal Zone showed a greater functional diversity than the one in the Antarctic Zone. The community structure changed over the course of the incubations in response to increased iron and light. The observed increase in chlorophyll-a under high light in the Polar Frontal Zone was driven predominantly by an increase in pico-(0.2–2 µm) and large (> 5 µm) nanophytoplankton. Pigment fingerprinting indicated an increase in the contribution of diatoms and Phaeocystis over the course of the incubation. In contrast, in the Antarctic Zone, the increase in chlorophyll-a after iron enrichment was predominantly due to an increase in the contribution of diatoms and large nanophytoplankton. The photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) was low at both sites at the beginning of the incubations, but increased upon iron fertilization in both water masses, indicating stress relief. However, the acclimation strategies fundamentally differed between the two communities. The ratio of photoprotective versus light-harvesting pigments increased under high light in the Polar Frontal Zone independent of iron enrichment, whereas this ratio declined upon iron enrichment in the Antarctic Zone even under high light. At the same time, the functional cross section of photosystem II ($\sigma$PSII) decreased upon iron enrichment in the Antarctic Zone, but not in the Polar Frontal Zone. Our experiments support the need to take biogeographical differences between Southern Ocean water masses into account when interpreting ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {A significant proportion of phototrophic species are known to be mixotrophs: cells that obtain nutrients through a combination of photosynthesis and prey ingestion. Current methods to estimate mixotroph abundance in situ are known to be limited in their ability to help identify conditions that favor mixotrophs over strict autotrophs. For the first time, we combine microscopic analysis of phototrophic taxa with immunoprecipitated bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)- labeled DNA amplicon sequencing to identify and quantify active and putative mixotrophs at 2 locations in a microtidal temperate estuary. We analyze these data to examine spatial and temporal variability of phytoplankton and mixotrophs. Microscopy-based phototrophic diversity and abundances reveal expected seasonal patterns for our 2 stations, with the start of growth in winter and highest abundances in summer. Diatoms tend to dominate at the site with less stratification, while dinoflagellates and euglenids are usually more prominent at the stratified station. The BrdU-based mixotroph identifications are translated to the microscopy identification and abundances to estimate the proportion of mixotrophs (cells >10 $\mu$m in size) at both sites. The average proportion of potential mixotrophs is higher at the station with higher stratification (51%) compared to the station with lower stratification (30%), and potential mixotrophs tend to be higher in summer, although we did not conduct BrdU experiments in any of the other seasons. Combining the identification of active mixotrophs through the uptake of BrdU-labeled bacteria with robust abundance measurements can expand our understanding of mixotrophs across systems.},

abstract = {Protists are traditionally described as either phototrophic or heterotrophic, but studies have indicated that mixotrophic species, organisms that combine both strategies, can have significant impacts on prey populations in marine microbial food webs. While estimates of active mixotroph abundances in environmental samples are determined microscopically by fluorescent particle ingestion, species identification is difficult. We developed SYBR-based qPCR strategies for three Antarctic algal species that we identified as mixotrophic. This method and traditional ingestion experiments were applied to determine the total mixotroph abundance in Antarctic water samples, to ascertain the abundance of known mixotrophic species, and to identify environmental variables that impact the distribution and abundance of these species. Despite differences in sampling locations and years, mixotroph distribution was strongly influenced by season. Environmental variables that best explained variation in the individual mixotroph species abundances included temperature, oxygen, date, fluorescence, conductivity, and latitude. Phosphate was identified as an additional explanatory variable when nutrients were included in the analysis. Utilizing culture-based grazing rates and qPCR abundances, the estimated summed impact on bacterial populations by the three mixotrophs was usually < 2% of the overall mixotrophic grazing, but in one sample, Pyramimonas was estimated to contribute up to 80% of mixotrophic grazing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

abstract = {Mixotrophy, the combination of phototrophy and heterotrophy within the same individual, is widespread in oceanic systems. Yet, neither the presence nor ecological impact of mixotrophs has been identified in an Arctic marine environment. We quantified nano- and picoplankton during early autumn in the Beaufort Sea and Canada Basin and determined relative rates of bacterivory by heterotrophs and mixotrophs. Results confirmed previous reports of low microbial biomass for Arctic communities in autumn. The impact of bacterivory was relatively low, ranging from 0.6 × 103 to 42.8 × 103 bacteria mL-1 day-1, but it was often dominated by pico- or nanomixotrophs. From 1% to 7% of the photosynthetic picoeukaryotes were bacterivorous, while mixotrophic nanoplankton abundance comprised 1-22% of the heterotrophic and 2-32% of the phototrophic nanoplankton abundance, respectively. The estimated daily grazing impact was usually < 5% of the bacterial standing stock, but impacts as high as 25% occurred. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns indicated that communities from different depths at the same site were appreciably different and that there was a shift in community diversity at the midpoint of the cruise. Sequence information from DGGE bands reflected microbes related to those from other Arctic studies, particularly from the Beaufort Sea. {\textcopyright} 2011 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract = {During a cruise from October to November 2019, along the West Antarctic Peninsula, between 64.32 and 68.37°S, we assessed the diversity and composition of the active microbial eukaryotic community within three size fractions: micro- (> 20 $\mu$m), nano- (20–5 $\mu$m), and pico-size fractions (5–0.2 $\mu$m). The communities and the environmental parameters displayed latitudinal gradients, and we observed a strong similarity in the microbial eukaryotic communities as well as the environmental parameters between the sub-surface and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) depths. Chlorophyll concentrations were low, and the mixed layer was shallow for most of the 17 stations sampled. The richness of the microplankton was higher in Marguerite Bay (our southernmost stations), compared to more northern stations, while the diversity for the nano- and pico-plankton was relatively stable across latitude. The microplankton communities were dominated by autotrophs, mostly diatoms, while mixotrophs (phototrophs-consuming bacteria and kleptoplastidic ciliates, mostly alveolates, and cryptophytes) were the most abundant and active members of the nano- and picoplankton communities. While phototrophy was the dominant trophic mode, heterotrophy (mixotrophy, phagotrophy, and parasitism) tended to increase southward. The samples from Marguerite Bay showed a distinct community with a high diversity of nanoplankton predators, including spirotrich ciliates, and dinoflagellates, while cryptophytes were observed elsewhere. Some lineages were significantly related—either positively or negatively—to ice coverage (e.g., positive for Pelagophyceae, negative for Spirotrichea) and temperature (e.g., positive for Cryptophyceae, negative for Spirotrichea). This suggests that climate changes will have a strong impact on the microbial eukaryotic community.},

@article{Edwards2019,
abstract = {Mixotrophy, the combination of autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition, is a common trophic strategy among unicellular eukaryotes in the ocean. There are a number of hypotheses about the conditions that select for mixotrophy, and field studies have documented the prevalence of mixotrophy in a range of environments. However, there is currently little evidence for how mixotrophy varies across environmental gradients, and whether empirical patterns support theoretical predictions. Here I synthesize experiments that have quantified the abundance of phototrophic, mixotrophic, and heterotrophic nanoflagellates, to ask whether there are broad patterns in the prevalence of mixotrophy (relative to pure autotrophy and heterotrophy), and to ask whether observed patterns are consistent with a trait-based model of trophic strategies. The data suggest that mixotrophs increase in abundance at lower latitudes, while autotrophs and heterotrophs do not, and that this may be driven by increased light availability. Both mixotrophs and autotrophs increase greatly in productive coastal environments, while heterotrophs increase only slightly. These patterns are consistent with a model of resource competition in which nutrients and carbon can both limit growth and mixotrophs experience a trade-off in allocating biomass to phagotrophy vs. autotrophic functions. Importantly, mixotrophy is selected for under a range of conditions even when mixotrophs experience a penalty for using a generalist trophic strategy, due to the synergy between photosynthetically derived carbon and prey-derived nutrients. For this reason mixotrophy is favored relative to specialist strategies by increased irradiance, while at the same time increased nutrient supply increases the competitive ability of mixotrophs against heterotrophs.},
