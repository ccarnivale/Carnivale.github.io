Welcome to my data analyst/scientist portfolio highlighting all of my most relevant work, especially my Ph.D. dissertation. Throughout you will find quick summaries of all of my work with links to the repositories where you can delve deeper into the statistics and programming I utilized to address important ecological or business questions and their solutions.

## Introduction
I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from Temple University, who defended my dissertation December 11,2024, and looking for work. Throughout my life, I have been drawn to solving puzzles and uncovering solutions. With a background in ecology and data science, I am passionate about applying these skills to tackle complex challenges. I am currently seeking opportunities to leverage my expertise and problem-solving mindset to support and enhance your company's success.

In my PhD dissertation work, I develop methods to: (1) assess the extent of bathymetrical and seasonal variation in microplastic pollution in the Southern Ocean, (2) estimate mixotrophic nanoplankton importance to the Southern Ocean carbon pump, and (3) understand the impact microplastics have on the nanoplanktonic community. I successfully defended my PhD on December 11, 2024.
